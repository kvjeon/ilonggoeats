            <p class="new-description">KBL is a savory stew that combines three main ingredients: kadyos (pigeon peas), baboy (pork), and langka (jackfruit). Each component brings its unique flavor and texture to the dish, creating a harmonious blend that is both hearty and satisfying.</p>
            <p class="new-description"> <b>Kadyos</b> These legumes add a creamy texture and earthy flavor to the stew. They are a great source of protein and contribute to the dish's heartiness.</p>
            <p class="new-description"><b>Baboy</b>: Tender pieces of pork are typically simmered until they become juicy and flavorful. The pork adds richness to the broth, enhancing the overall taste of the dish.</p>
            <p class="new-description"><b>Langka</b>: The inclusion of ripe or unripe jackfruit provides a sweet contrast to the savory elements. When cooked, it becomes soft and tender, absorbing the flavors of the stew.</p>
            <p class="new-description">The dish is often seasoned with spices, herbs, and condiments such as ginger, garlic, and onions, which elevate its flavor profile. KBL is commonly enjoyed with steamed rice, making it a comforting meal that is perfect for family gatherings or special occasions.</p>
