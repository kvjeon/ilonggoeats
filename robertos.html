            <img src="3.jpg" class="new-image">
            <p class="new-description">Roberto's Restaurant is a well-loved dining destination located in Iloilo City, Philippines, renowned for its delicious and authentic Ilonggo cuisine. Established in the heart of the city, it has become a favorite spot for both locals and tourists looking to experience the rich culinary heritage of the region. Roberto‚Äôs siopao is the heart and soul of the restaurant‚Äôs menu. What makes it so special is not just the taste, but also the variety of options available. The siopao comes in several sizes and types, with fillings that elevate this traditional steamed bun into something truly exceptional. Among the most popular is the Queen siopao, a massive bun filled with a delightful combination of pork, chicken, Chinese sausage, and salted egg. The Queen siopao is so popular that it often sells out quickly, leaving customers eager to return for a chance to grab one. Other varieties, such as the regular, jumbo, and King siopao, offer different filling combinations but are all equally satisfying.</p>
